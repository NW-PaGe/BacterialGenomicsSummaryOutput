# Bacterial Genomics Summary Output

This is a Quarto project that uses multiple R scripts to load and wrangle the output files from BigBacter runs wiht the goal of producing an HTML summary report.
This project does not conduct genomic analysis but it provides an overview of the categorization of new sequenced isolates in genomic clusters.
